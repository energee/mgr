# The improvement loop

How this repo improves itself, which automation owns which kind of change,
and which model tier each one runs. Read this before adding a new automated
workflow — extend one of these loops instead if it fits.

## The loops

| Loop | Cadence | Owns | Model |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| [Sentry harness](../sentry-harness-setup.md) | Weekdays (17:00 UTC) | Production/runtime bugs → fix PRs | Sonnet |
| [Scheduled health audit](health-audit-and-issue-triage.md#scheduled-automation) | Weekly (Wed 13:37 UTC) | Static correctness audit → deduplicated issues | Default |
| Nightly Bug Patrol (`bug-patrol.yml`) | Daily (07:00 UTC) | One small, high-confidence bug fix → single PR | Sonnet |
| [autoharness](autoharness.md) | On demand (`autoharness optimize`) | Mechanical `src/lib` refactors | Sonnet |
| Quality re-grade (`quality-regrade.yml`) | Weekly (Mon 06:00 UTC) | [quality.md](quality.md) scorecard + trend log → docs-only PR | Sonnet |
| Weekly Feedback Distillation (`feedback-distill.yml`) | Weekly (Sun 08:00 UTC) | Recurring corrections → docs-only PR (this loop) | Default |
| CI gates (`test.yml`, `db-lint.yml`, `make check`) | Every PR (static+unit); weekday nightly (build+E2E) | Coverage ratchets, DB lint, type/lint/test | none |

(The re-grade was rebuilt 2026-07-24: v1 was removed the same day after 10
runs that produced nothing — it lacked `--allowedTools`. The rebuild pins the
allowlist explicitly and, like every scheduled agentic workflow, ends in the
`require-durable-outcome` gate; the once-promised scheduled-agent replacement
was never built and that route is retired.)

(Bug Patrol is a 2026-07-26 revise candidate per the loop scoreboard: both
scheduled runs since it was added ended `error_max_turns` with zero PRs —
07-25 hit the then-cap at 60 turns / 9 permission denials, so #598 raised the
cap to 80, and the very next run on 07-26 hit *that* cap too, at 81 turns / 20
permission denials. Denials rose faster than the turn budget did, so the
ceiling is not the bottleneck — something in the task keeps reaching for a
tool outside `--allowedTools` in `bug-patrol.yml` and burning turns on the
retry. Next attempt should audit which tool that is before raising
`--max-turns` a third time. Falsifies if a future run merges a PR or a
quiet-run.md without another `error_max_turns`; stays failed if the scoreboard
still shows 0 PRs / repeated `error_max_turns` after two more scheduled runs.)

The loops compose: CI gates make the generative loops safe (a bad
automated PR cannot merge green), and the weekly re-grade tells you whether
the week's merges actually moved codebase health — its trend log is the
feedback signal for where to point the next autoharness campaign or manual
session.

## Model-tier policy

Rule of thumb: **the stronger the external gate, the lighter the model.**

- **Sonnet** for anything whose output is mechanically validated before it
  lands: sentry-fix PRs (reproducing test + typecheck/test/lint + `make
  check` + review pass), autoharness proposals (typecheck+vitest screening),
  rubric-driven regrades. A weaker model here costs retries, not correctness.
- **Default/stronger model** for work where the gate is human judgment:
  interactive sessions, design decisions, `@claude` mentions (`claude.yml`
  intentionally stays on default). Automated per-PR review was removed
  2026-07-16 with the CI minutes diet — run `/code-review` locally before
  pushing, or comment `@claude review this` on a PR for an on-demand pass.
  The scheduled health audit also stays on the default model because a schema
  can validate finding shape but cannot mechanically prove the diagnosis.

## Durable outcomes

Every scheduled agentic workflow ends in
`.github/actions/require-durable-outcome`: it must leave a PR, a verifiable
citation, or an evidence-citing `quiet-run.md` — otherwise the run goes red.
Quiet no-op runs are healthy; an *undetectable* no-op run is the failure mode
that killed re-grade v1. The weekly distillation reads a deterministic loop
scoreboard (4-week PR acceptance per loop) so a loop whose output stops being
merged becomes a visible retire/revise candidate instead of silent API spend.

Distillation itself is two-directional: every promotion must name the
observable behavior it should change and the recurrence signal that would mark
it failed, and every weekly PR must also propose retirements (gotchas entries
now enforced by gates, routes to removed things, promotions that changed
nothing). Enforced knowledge accumulates; prose must not.

## Worker epochs

Two loops (health audit, feedback distillation) deliberately ride the
claude-code-action **default** model; the others pin Sonnet. The durable-
outcome gate echoes `worker-epoch: model=<id>` into every run's step summary.
When that id changes — usually via a dependabot bump of the pinned
claude-code-action SHA, or Anthropic moving the action default — treat it as a
**new worker epoch**: requalify the affected prompts against a recent run or
two, and ask the subtraction question (is any scaffolding now redundant?)
before adding anything new. Current epoch at last review (2026-07-24):
Sonnet loops on `claude-sonnet-5`, default loops on the action default.

## Weekly rhythm

1. Merged sentry-fix PRs accumulate during the week; review/merge them like
   any PR. `needs-human` label = the harness gave up, finish manually.
2. Monday's re-grade PR shows what shifted. A falling grade names the next
   target.
3. Wednesday's health audit checks recent changes and one rotating correctness
   domain. Review its automated issues before implementation.
4. Point a bounded loop at that target: an autoharness campaign if it's
   mechanical cleanup in `src/lib`, a normal session otherwise.
5. Ratchet what you fixed: bump the vitest coverage floor / shrink an
   allowlist so the gain can't silently regress.
